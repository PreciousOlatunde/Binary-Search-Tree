# Binary-Search-Tree
The program finds the K-th smallest element in a preset binary tree

How to execute/run the binarySearchTree program

Files needed:
1. node.h
2. node.cpp
3. main.cpp
4. makefile

Execution:
1. All of the aforementioned files should be in the same folder
2. The folder where the files are should be your present working directory
3. On the Terminal, type and enter the command "make clean" to remove any executables from previous compilations
4. Enter the command "make run" in Terminal to compile and execute the program

Using the running program:
1. The program first prompts you to enter an integer for the value of k. This should be between 1 and 15 inclusive. 
2. The program then returns the kth smallest element in the tree.
3. The program then prints out each element in the BST in in-order traversal formal (left-root-right).
4. The program then prints out the elements in the BST in an indented format that allows you to see the integers that are at the same depth. The left most element is the root of the tree and the right-most elements are the leaves.
